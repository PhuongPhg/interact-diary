### **1. Overview**
#### 1.1. Introduction:
- Name: Interact-diary
- Type: website
- Purpose: The website where users can write diary about the story between them and everyone around.

#### 1.2. Background:
The life is so hard that sometimes, people forget the stories about everyone around which can be either bad or good stories. The lack of those stories makes our lives more tedious and boring, forgetting about life experiences regardless of good or bad, flawed appreciation of surrounding relationships.

### **2. Goals**
We want to build an website to help the users in:
- Write their feelings everyday
- Can see the list of stories with someone, base on that, the user can they can evaluate the relationship of that people.
- When they have a bad day, they can search for the sweet story for some sweet "cháo hành" base on the rating/mood-checking.
- Practice writing skills 
- Express feelings

### **3. Highlights**
The special of this website is that it's the place for user to write their story about some people around them. Stories for each person are aggregated into a separate category so they can easily see their interactions with that person.

Another things is the rating/mood-checking. The user can check how good or bad for each story. Base on that score, the website can recommend the suitable stories so they can feel better.
